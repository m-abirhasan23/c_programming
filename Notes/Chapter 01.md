## Variable

#### What is variable ?

**Variable are like bucket/ box where we can put our data and can use it when necessary**

### Rules of writing variables

- variable are case sensitive
- the first character should be alphabet or \_ (underscore) nothing else going to works
- you can't write comma, or special character apart form (\_) in your variable

## Data types

### What is data type

_A data type is a attribute associated with a peace of data that tells compiler how and which type of is this_

- There are so many data type in C Programming language but **there are two main data type exist**

  1.  Signed Datatype
  2.  Unsigned Data Types

  ### Here is most used data type in c

  - Integer (int) // eg: 1,2,3
  - Float (float) // eg: 2.2,4.5
  - Character(char) // eg: a,b,c

_Remember Char only can store single character not string_

## Constant

### What is constant?

_Constant is type of variable where we can store that can't be change like for example the value of PI. The Value of always be 3.1416 it will never change for this case we can use constant variable in my code eg : const int PI = 54896;_

## Keywords

**Keywords are words that reserve of c complier that we can use them in variable name. there are total number of 32 words in that are called c key words**

### Why can't we use them ?

**In Compiler Those 32 words have special meaning that we can't replace that why**

## Input Output

## Compiler

**Compiler is machine or function that converts our raw code/source code in machine readable code aka binary**
